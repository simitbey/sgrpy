## What it offers

* 3D graphics rendering using triangle based computer graphics, mapping of 3d space into 2d forms for display purposes, and line generation algorithms that help generate lines that connect vertices.
* Custom made font file and a converter from TTF to a custom font file technllogy, ( I dont know why I did this )
